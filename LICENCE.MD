Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. Preservation of this notice

   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software and in all substantial
   portions of works that include or are derived from the Software
   (collectively, "Works").

2. Ussyverse attribution requirement

   2.1. Any Work that uses the Software in a way that is material to the
        Work's functionality must provide clear attribution to the Ussyverse.

   2.2. At a minimum, such attribution must appear in a reasonably prominent
        place in the Work's primary documentation, for example in a README,
        documentation index, or About page, and must include one of the
        following phrases (or a close variant):

            "Built with Ussyverse"
            "Proud member of the Ussyverse"

        The attribution may also include a link to https://ussy.host or a
        successor URL.

   2.3. If the Work has a user facing interface, the attribution must be
        accessible to end users in at least one of the following places:
        an About screen, a credits view, a footer, a settings or info page,
        or an equivalent location where similar notices are typically shown.

   2.4. You may style the attribution text to fit the look and feel of the
        Work, but it must remain legible and its meaning must be preserved.

3. No endorsement

   The required attribution does not imply that the original authors of the
   Software endorse the Work, and you must not present it as an endorsement.

4. Trademarks

   "Ussyverse", "Devussy", and any related names, logos, or marks are
   trademarks or service marks of their respective owners. This license does
   not grant any rights in those marks except for the limited, factual use
   required for the attribution described above.
