## Decisions

- 2025-12-07: Adopt an in-memory Level API (GET/POST) early for rapid QA; plan to migrate to full JSON Schema validation later (Ajv) when feasible.
- 2025-12-07: Use a separate Levels admin UI scaffold with vanilla TS and optional React variant to enable rapid iteration in parallel with the backend API.
- 2025-12-07: Keep devplan/devplan.md unchanged until Bossy approves a refresh; propose a migration path to regenerate devplan/dashboard to reflect current swarm state.
