Security considerations for browser game code (OWASP-aligned)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Avoid eval/dynamic code
- Prevent XSS in UI
- Secure storage: avoid leaking data in localStorage/cookies; sanitize tokens
- CSRF protection for server interactions
- Session management: secure HttpOnly cookies; short lifetimes
- Dependency management: keep libs up-to-date; verify signatures
- Client-side security: feature flags; minimize exposed functionality
- Error handling: do not leak stack traces
- Logging/telemetry: avoid collecting sensitive data without consent
