# Frontend for repository-backed Task API

This minimal React frontend demonstrates per-project task endpoints:
- List tasks: GET /projects/{project_id}/tasks
- Create task: POST /projects/{project_id}/tasks
- Update task: PATCH /projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}

Run locally with your backend and wire in API host if needed.
