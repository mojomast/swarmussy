Project Kickoff Plan

Triggered by: cleanup.txt (currently empty, kickoff proceeds with default kickoff flow).

1) Objective
- Establish a formal kickoff for the cleanup workflow, create centralized planning artifacts, and prepare for execution by swarm roles.

2) Scope
- Create master_plan.md describing the project goals, constraints, and success criteria.
- Create devplan.md as a live dashboard for tracking kickoff tasks and blockers.
- Define initial roles and responsibilities for the swarm and outline the ensuing task flow after 'Go'.

3) Deliverables
- scratch/shared/master_plan.md
- scratch/shared/devplan.md
- An initial swarm kickoff ready for execution via 'Go'.

4) Roles & Responsibilities
- Docy McWriter: Draft master_plan.md and devplan.md (planning artifacts).
- Checky McManager: Oversee kickoff alignment and risk tracking.
- Deployo McOps: Prepare for swarm initialization and worker provisioning.
- Codey McBackend: Reserved for backend tasks during kickoff (to be assigned after 'Go').
- Pixel McFrontend: Reserved for frontend tasks during kickoff (to be assigned after 'Go').
- Bugsy McTester: Reserved for QA tasks during kickoff (to be assigned after 'Go').

5) Milestones
- M1: Master plan and dev plan drafted.
- M2: Swarm provisioning plan prepared.
- M3: Task assignment plan ready for execution after 'Go'.

6) Success Criteria
- master_plan.md and devplan.md exist and are readable.
- The swarm has a clear path to spawn/assign workers upon approval.

7) Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Ambiguity in kickoff requirements. Mitigation: Use devplan to capture evolving requirements and approvals.

8) Approvals
- This plan requires acknowledgment by Kyle (user) via 'Go' to proceed.
