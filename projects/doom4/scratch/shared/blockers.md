## Active Blockers
- ⚠️ API contracts finalization: need Bossy's confirmation on preferred versioning policy and endpoints. Dependencies on master_plan updates.
- ⚠️ Backend readiness: in-progress API wiring; potential cross-language CI drift.
- ⚠️ Scheduling: aligning multiple teams to sync dashboards and devplan updates.

## What help is needed
- Bossy to approve final API contract version and mirror in master_plan/devplan.
- Codey McBackend to finalize in-memory store schemas and ensure endpoints stable.
