# EngineCore Integration Plan

- Bridge EngineCore with app shell and backend contract for profile CRUD flows.
- Provide integration tests scaffolding: Scratch shared tests and a small jest/mocha harness.
- Outline event contracts: doom-bootstrap-profile (incoming) and doom-core-profile-updated (outgoing)
