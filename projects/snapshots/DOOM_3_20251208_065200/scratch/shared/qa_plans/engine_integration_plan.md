# Engine Integration QA Plan

- Objective: Validate EngineCore integration with the backend world store across levels and players.
- Scope: tick gravity, level/player interaction, start/stop flow, and end-to-end mock UI flow.
- Approach: unit tests for core tick, integration scaffolding, and a mock UI flow description with endpoints.
