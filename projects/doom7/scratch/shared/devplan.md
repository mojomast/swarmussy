# Dev Plan

Phase: Planning

Current Phase Details
- Goal: Prepare a concrete plan for Phase 1: skeleton + engine core + basic render + player controls.
- Status: Draft
- Next Steps: Break down tasks into concrete subtasks, assign to team roles, and initialize task tracking.

Milestones (live)
- M1 Scaffolding: project skeleton
- M2 Engine Skeleton: core loop
- M3 Player & Shooting: basic controls

Team Assignments (initial rough plan)
- Codey: Engine core and rendering
- Pixel: Editor UI shims and viewport
- Schema: Editor data schemas and sample JSONs
- Swagger: API design for future networked features (placeholder)
- Bugsy: Testing plan
- Checky: Progress tracking

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Scope creep. Mitigation: Strict phase-based plan with sign-off before proceeding.
