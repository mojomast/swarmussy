Phase 2 OpenAPI draft contracts and runtime wire-up plan

- Draft OpenAPI surface is defined at shared/openapi/phase2.yaml.next
- Additional scaffolding: shared/tests/api/test_phase2_endpoints.py
- Documentation alignment: scratch/shared/docs/phase2_readme.md

Notes:
- This document is intentionally lightweight to unblock integration work while Phase 2 contracts are reviewed.
- Review blockers should be logged in blockers.md and phase2 milestones tracked in master_plan.
