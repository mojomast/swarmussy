Bonus Mode Initiative Plan

Objective
- Introduce a structured incentive program to accelerate delivery, reward high-quality contributions, and improve time-to-market for critical middleware and QA work.

Scope
- Establish measurable criteria for top-performer awards tied to sprint goals: enforcing JWT middleware on main routes, expanding QA harness coverage for token flows, and improving CI/CD readiness.
- Define eligibility, payout/recognition, review cadence, and governance.
- Create supporting documentation and dashboards to track progress.

Stakeholders
- Kyle (Product Lead / Customer)
- Bossy McArchitect (Swarm Orchestrator)
- Checky McManager (Project Manager)
- Docy McWriter (Technical Writer)
- Codey McBackend (Backend Task Lead)
- Deployo McOps (Tech Ops)

Success Criteria
- Clear Bonus Mode policy published and accessible
- At least 2 concrete tasks completed per sprint with high-quality results
- Documentation updated and QA harness extended to cover new flows
- No regressions introduced in OTP/JWT middleware flow

Risks & Mitigations
- Misalignment on eligibility: establish transparent criteria and a public policy doc
- Gaming of the system: implement guardrails and audit logs for bonus awards
- Scope creep: lock scope to sprint goals and require plan changes via quick retro

Milestones
- Week 1: Draft policy, publish, and socialize
- Week 2: Tie policy to live tasks and adjust devplan accordingly
- Week 3: First bonus awards based on performance with retrospective

Governance & Review
- Weekly standups to review eligibility and progress
- End-of-sprint retro with bonus awards approved by Checky McManager

Communication
- All bonus policy updates to scratch/shared/docs/bonus_mode.md
- Regular announcements in project channel

Bonus Mode Enablement
- Bonus Mode policy document at scratch/shared/docs/bonus_mode.md defines eligibility, scoring, payout, and governance.
- Points ledger stored at scratch/shared/bonus_mode/points.json to track contributions.
- Periodic reviews and awards to be conducted during sprint retros and documented in master_plan notes.
